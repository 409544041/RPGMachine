This is an ongoing project for Unity 3D, to create an open source and efficient framework for roleplaying games. It will cover most common mechanics in Roleplaying games of all kinds, both Western and Eastern, and will come with an internal editor and enough scripts to allow for a simple game to be developed without any need for extensive scripting!
