# RPGMachine

This is an ongoing project for Unity 3D, to create an open source and efficient framework for roleplaying games. It will cover most common mechanics in Roleplaying games of all kinds, both Western and Eastern, and will come with an internal editor and enough scripts to allow for a simple game to be developed and even deployed and sold without any need for extensive scripting!


To achieve that goal, a number of different open source projects were gathered and united to provide a strong back end to this framework. Most notably:

NCalc
HTMLEngine
C-Sharp Parser
Hex Tile Manager


Also the full source code will be available always, both for the Editor Extensions and the Framework itself, to allow any changes eventually needed to be done to the source to happen seamlessly. Our goal with this is provide an incentive for more RPG games to be created in the Unity Engine, by reducing both the cost and the amount of base work needed in order to make such an endeavor possible, allowing more people in varied levels of skill with Game Creation to be able to in an easier way create RPG games, and ultimately providing subsides to the creation of a self supporting RPG Game Creation community specialized in this framework and it's inner workings.


# Why Unity 3D?

The decision for Unity 3D was not done carelessly. Unity 3D is, as of today, an industry standard when talking about Indie Game Development. It's free version has tools already which at the very least rival with the other tools used today in creating Roleplaying Games, be it in a hobbyist scale or commercially, on the free version it already allows for the release of games in platforms like Android and iOS, which are today very interesting platforms for any developer, and while indeed too expensive for any starting developers, the Pro licence allows for games on a graphical par with most commercial RPG titles available in the market today. And regardless of the starting price, there is no revenue drop due to paying royalties to Unity 3D.

So the choice for Unity 3D came in easily. The fact it allowed it's own editor to be improved and specialized to be used as an easy editor for the games also counted as a big selling point for such a decision. And on the event of the rise of a Game Engine with similar characteristics and popularity in the future, a brench of this source is possible to port these tools to the new platform.
